               ;; will not do anything else until we have processed
               ;; that command & written the response.

               ;; There are two special cases where that does not
               ;; hold:

               ;; 1. the "idle" command: the client expects no
               ;; response, and may follow up with a "noidle" quickly
               ;; enough that it appears in the same message to
               ;; us. I.e. `text' could look like "idle foo bar
               ;; splat\nnoidle\n". Nb. the client will never send
               ;; anything more than that, since it expects an OK in
               ;; response to the noidle command.

               ;; 2. command lists: this is unlikely, but depending on the
               ;; underlying transport and its configuration, if the client
               ;; issues a lengthy command list, it may show up here in pieces; i.e.
               ;; `text' could be something like "command_list_begin\nfoo\ba",
               ;; followed by "r\nspla" and finally "t\nend_command_list\n". This
               ;; method would have to recognize that it's accumulating a lengthy
               ;; command list & only act when it's complete.
               ;;
               ;; Now that I think about this some more, this is true
               ;; of *any* command if it's long enough relative to the
               ;; underlying transport-- I could probably construct a
               ;; socket with a sufficiently pathological
               ;; configuration that "idle player stored_playlist
               ;; options mixer sticker\n" would be broken up into
               ;; multiple messages.
