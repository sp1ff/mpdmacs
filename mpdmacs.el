;;; Commentary:

;; "Music Player Daemon (MPD) is a flexible, powerful, server-side
;; application for playing music."  <https://www.musicpd.org/>.
;; mpdmacs is a lightweight MPD client for Emacs.

;; See also mpdel <https://gitea.petton.fr/mpdel/mpdel >, as well as
;; the mpc package which ships with Emacs beginning with version 23.2.

;; mpdmacs requires elmpd <https://github.com/sp1ff/elmpd>, a
;; lightweight asynchronous library for building MPD clients.  My goal
;; is to have Emacs never freeze or pause while running this package.

;; Communications Model:

;; mpd encourages "throwaway" connections; i.e. a pattern in which a
;; connection to the server is made, one or a few commands are issued,
;; and the connection then closed down (the default server-side
;; timeout is 60 seconds).

;; The one exception is the "idle" command, which clients can use
;; to receive notifications of server-side changes.  When a client
;; issues the "idle" command, server-side timeouts are disabled.

;; mpdmacs uses a single `elmpd-connection' (which itself uses a
;; socket over which it will talk to MPD along with a callback for
;; servicing server-side changes).  The connection will immediately be
;; put into "idle" mode.  Commands issued through this package will
;; cause a "noidle" command to be issued on that connection before the
;; commands are issued; after the commands complete, the connection
;; will again be placed into "idle" mode.
