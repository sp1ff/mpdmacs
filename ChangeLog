	Prepare the branch for merging.
	Update the version to 0.3.0, update README & NEWS, and so forth.

	Add a reverse index from song to playlists in which that song is included.
	This patch augments `mpdmacs-show-current-song` so as to display
	the playlists in which the current track is included. This requires
	building up a reverse index from song to playlists, which is done
	every time the current song changes.

	This patch also cleans-up some miscellanea:

	    - clean-up the release workflow
	    - remove all the byte-compilation warnings
	    - update the manual tests to point to localhost rather than .6
	    - update the Github workflow to Python 3.10
	    - address a few nits

	Minor tweak to current-song logic

2020-11-17  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	A few minor updates in response to MELPA feedback from @riscy <https://github.com/melpa/melpa/pull/7190>.

2020-11-12  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Fixed typo in the 'mpdmacs-mode' docstring.

2020-11-11  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Re-cast 'mpdmacs' as a minor-mode.
	When submitting 'mpdmacs' to MELPA, @riscy noted that since 'mpdmacs'
	is running hooks & defining a keymap, perhaps it would make more
	sense to deliver it as a minor-mode, which I have done.

2020-10-29  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Incorporate feedback from @riscy at MELPA.
	    1. Use #' in 'mpdmacs-log'

	    2. Be careful to never overwrite existing bindings when
	       setting up my keymap by making them in a let-binding
	       within the defvar.

2020-10-20  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>
