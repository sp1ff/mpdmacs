* Introduction

[[https://github.com/sp1ff/mpdmacs][mpdmacs-mode]] is a global minor-mode that turns Emacs into a lightweight, ergonomic [[https://www.musicpd.org/][MPD]] client.
* Prerequisites

Emacs 29.1 & [[https://melpa.org/#/elmpd][elmpd]] latest.
* Installing

This is available on [[https://melpa.org][MELPA]] as well as Autotools source tarballs:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  curl -L -O https://github.com/mpdmacs/archive/0.4.1.tar.gz
  tar xf mpdmacs-0.4.1.tar.gz && cd mpdmacs-0.4.1
  ./configure && make all check
  sudo make install
#+END_SRC
* Getting Started

Pull in =mpdmacs= as usual via =require=: =(require 'mpdmacs)=. Configure =mpdmacs= to connect to your MPD server by customizing the variables:

  - =mpdmacs-host= & =mpdmacs-port=: If you're talking over a TCP socket, configure these two variables with the hostname and port number at which MPD is listening
  - =mpdmacs-socket=: If your MPD server is local & listening on a Unix socket, set this variable to its path. If you want to talk over a TCP socket, best to set this to nil (=mpdmacs-mode=, below, will try the local socket first, if it exists).

At this point, =mpdmacs= has done nothing: you need to explicitly enable it by calling =(mpdmacs-mode)=. This will open a connection to your MPD server, begin monitoring its state for changes, and enable you to begin issuing commands.

=mpdmacs= supplies several interactive commands, with keybindings in =mpdmacs-mode-keymap=; you may want to map a chord you find convenient to that keymap like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (defun my-mpdmacs-hook ()
    (global-set-key "\C-c m" 'mpdmacs-mode-keymap))
  (add-hook 'mpdmacs-mode-hook 'my-mpdmacs-hook)
#+END_SRC

If you ever want to turn =mpdmacs= off, you can invoke =(mpdmacs-mode)= again.
* Motivation & Philosophy

There are already capable MPD clients out there such as [[https://gitea.petton.fr/mpdel/mpdel][mpdel]] & [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/mpc.el][mpc]] so why another? I've tried both & like them fine, but they're full-featured MPD clients. I hope that =mpdmacs= will fill a different role, that of an unobtrusive assistant while you're using Emacs for other things. If you want to, say, display & edit the current play queue, you would go to one of them. If you just want to skip to the next track with a quick key sequence while doing something else, use =mpdmacs=.
* Learning More or Contributing

At the time of this writing, =mpdmacs.el= consists of a few hundred lines of code, so if you're looking to customize or hack on it, dive in! Comments, complaints, suggestions & PRs welcome.
* Status & Roadmap

Basic playback functionality is there, but that's pretty much it except for a few other little features like adding the current song to the mode line. Comments, suggestions & bug reports welcome in the [[https://github.com/sp1ff/mpdmacs/issues][issues]] or at [[mailto:sp1ff@pobox.com][sp1ff@pobox.com]].
